Submitted by: **Andrew Liu**

**Flixter+** is a movie browsing app that allows users to browse ... [TODO] 

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Choose any endpoint on The MovieDB API except `now_playing`**
  - Chosen Endpoint: `get-movie-details`
- [X] **Make a request to your chosen endpoint and implement a RecyclerView to display all entries**
- [X] **Use Glide to load and display at least one image per entry**
- [X] **Click on an entry to view specific details about that entry using Intents**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] **Add another API call and RecyclerView that lets the user interact with different data.** 
- [ ] **Add rounded corners to the images using the Glide transformations**
- [X] **Implement a shared element transition when user clicks into the details of a movie**

## Notes

It was difficult to see which onClick function ran when interacting with a movie. My endpoint also had no need to implement as a RecyclerView, since it was only one item. It was also interesting to see how API calls are processed.
